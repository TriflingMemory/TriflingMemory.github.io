<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<h2 id="distributed-likes">Distributed&nbsp;likes</h2>
<p>Most social websites resolve around finding the good little bits hidden around the internet and showing them to the people who might like&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>This is normally done using a like/up-vote/stumble/dig or whatever button. A central authority collects all the likes/votes/stumbles/dugs or whatever and processes&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>We could replace that system by assigning a unique crypto-currency address to every piece of distributed content. Sending crypto-currency to that address equals a upvote. It is now up to any 3<span class="ord">th</span> party to aggregate the “likes” and provide suggestions to similar&nbsp;content.</p>
<p>Enabling likes for your digital content requires you to do two things. Generate a new unique crypto-currency address and paste this address on your content. Like this (look at the lower left corner of the&nbsp;comic):</p>
<p><img src="/articles/distributed-likes/strongest-princess.svg" alt="The strongest princess"></p>
<p>You should use a different address for every piece of likeable content. There are exceptions for this, if you distribute the same content in different formats or if you distribute a new minor version of the same content. You are allowed to use the same address in those cases. Deviate work from a different artist <span class="caps">MUST</span> always use a different&nbsp;address.</p>
<p>In addition pasting this address you need to sign your content. This facilitates address -&gt; content lookups. I am not about the best way to do this. It might look like&nbsp;this: </p>

<p>Everything between the <span class="caps">BEGIN</span> and END block is signed. This signed message does not need to be visible to any user. It only needs to be indexed by the search&nbsp;engines.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;good:</p>
<ul>
<li>No single central authority can influence the&nbsp;votes.</li>
<li>Any digital content can be “like-able”.&nbsp;Sound/text/links.</li>
<li>Duplicated content on different sites (which still has the same associated address) still receives upvotes in the same&nbsp;bucket.</li>
</ul>
<p>I consider that last point its greatest&nbsp;benefit.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody can influence the&nbsp;votes.</li>
<li>Crypto-currency was not designed as global upvote system. I used dogecoin address above, but there might exist more suited&nbsp;currencies.</li>
<li>Doing a reverse search (crypto-currency address to content) is not simple. You need to employ a search engine and hope the content provider put the address in plain&nbsp;text.</li>
<li>No analysis and aggregation software for something like this exist. Creating this software requires tackling a few hard&nbsp;challenges.</li>
<li>You need crypto-currency software and crypto-currency to like&nbsp;something.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of research needs to be done if this is&nbsp;feasible.</p>
